# GeoTrainer

GeoTrainer is the name of a geography game that I've been working on sporadically over the past couple of years. The game is almost finished, but since the [ninety-ninety rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule) is applicable, there is no end in sight at this time. The guiding principle behind the project has been to take every (or every other) opportunity to reinvent the wheel. In particular, a do-it-yourself approach to GUI-development has helped in giving GeoTrainer something of a retro feel.

## Gameplay

The game asks you to find a country/region or a city. You answer by clicking on the map. That's all there is to it. Three different game modes are available: Arcade, Educational and Time Trial. There are several different maps to choose from, and high scores are kept for each map for the Arcade and Time Trial game modes. Different color schemes and filters can be chosen to change the appearance of the game.

## Technicalities

GeoTrainer relies on [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) to manage video, audio and keyboard and mouse input. It is currently being developed on a Windows machine, but should be easily portable to other platforms. A [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) project file (geotrainer.cbp) is found in the repository and should be useful for anyone interesting in building and running the game.

## Documentation

At the moment, documentation for the project is scarce at best. Hopefully, on a rainy day not too far into the future, I will choose a trusty documentation generator and get to work on fixing this unfortunate situation.
